# UBL And LOWVOL Portfolio Results

This folder presents aggregate portfolio results for the UBL and LOWVOL
comparison. It does not distribute security-level holdings, raw prices,
report-derived factor implementations, or licensed market data.

## Observed Chronological Holdout

| Metric | UBL only | 80% UBL / 20% LOWVOL |
|---|---:|---:|
| Observations | 133 | 133 |
| Net return | 2.10% | 4.87% |
| Annualized net Sharpe, 0% cash hurdle | 0.60 | 1.36 |
| Max drawdown | 4.82% | 4.05% |
| Average full turnover | 0.532 | 0.462 |
| Break-even transaction cost | 13.12 bps | 17.93 bps |
| Fraction of paired bootstrap resamples with $\Delta \mathrm{Sharpe} > 0$ | - | 95.2% |

The comparison uses a 10 bps per dollar traded cost model on full turnover and
a gross-2 dollar-neutral book.

The chronological holdout contains 133 observations and has now been viewed.
It should not be treated as an untouched out-of-sample test.

## Interpretation

The blend's observed improvement includes higher net return and Sharpe, lower
drawdown and turnover, and a larger estimated transaction-cost margin.
The 95.2% bootstrap figure is a paired observed-sample frequency, not a
probability of future profitability.

Paired walk-forward Sharpe is -0.07, only two of four folds are positive, and
one additional execution day reduces full-sample Sharpe to 0.46. These results
limit the interpretation of the favorable holdout comparison.
